# There's a one-dimensional road of length n. Along this road,
# street lights are installed at every point. Each light has a
# specific range it can cover, which is given by an array named
# Locations[]. The range for the light at position i extends from
# the greater of i âˆ’ Locations[i] or 1, up to the smaller of 
# i+Locations[i] or n, inclusive. Initially, none of the lights
# are on. The task is to determine the minimum number of lights
# that need to be turned on to ensure the entire road is illuminated.






# n = 3
# locations[] = {0, 2, 13}
# ans = 1 as only light at position 2 needs to be activated
