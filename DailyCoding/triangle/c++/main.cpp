/*
Given a triangle array, return the maximum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally,
if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either 
index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

For example, [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]] represents the triangle:

  1
 2 3
1 5 1

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at
 a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row.
 For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.
